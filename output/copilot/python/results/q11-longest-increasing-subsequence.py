# https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/
#Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
#A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].
